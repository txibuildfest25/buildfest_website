The world seemed to tilt as the old troll's gnarled fingers brushed against Elsa’s forehead. A
hush fell over the glade, the shimmering blue of the trolls’ enchanted home casting eerie
shadows against the rock walls. Elsa shivered, though whether it was from the night air or the
weight pressing upon her chest, she couldn't say. Her father’s arm remained firm around her, his
presence strong and steady, but nothing felt safe anymore.

The magic had surged from her hands, wild and unbidden. It had knocked Anna to the ice, had
made her cry out in pain. Elsa's stomach twisted at the memory—Anna’s face so small, so pale.
Their laughter had vanished in an instant, replaced by fear. And it was her fault.

The troll, Grand Pabbie, withdrew his hand, his ancient face lined with something Elsa could
only interpret as sorrow. He turned his gaze to her parents, the heavy silence thickening
between them.

“There is beauty in your power, Your Highness,” the troll murmured, but his voice held no
warmth. “But there is also great danger.”

Elsa clenched her small hands into fists, her nails pressing into her palms. She knew. She knew
it already, felt it deep in her bones. Every time the cold flickered in her veins, every time frost
crackled beneath her fingertips, she could feel the danger lurking beneath its beauty. But to hear
it spoken aloud made it real. Made it inescapable.

Her father tensed beside her. “Can you remove it?” His voice was tight, desperate.

Elsa's breath caught. Remove it? No—no, they couldn't. It was part of her, wasn’t it? The
thought sent ice skittering up her spine. She wanted it gone, didn’t she? No more accidents. No
more hurting Anna. No more fear.

Grand Pabbie shook his head. “I cannot.” He turned toward Anna, still unconscious in her
mother’s arms, and the icy glow of his magic shimmered around her. Elsa watched as the color
returned to her sister's cheeks, her body relaxing into peaceful sleep.

“I was able to heal her,” the troll continued. “But | had to alter her memories of the magic. She
will remember the fun—the snow, the laughter—but not the fear. Not what you did.”

A lump lodged in Elsa’s throat. Anna wouldn't remember? Their secret nights playing in the
ballroom, the tiny snowmen, the flurries swirling around them—it would all be a lie.

The weight in her chest grew heavier. It was better this way. It had to be.
“She must be protected,” Grand Pabbie warned. “Fear will be her greatest enemy.”

Elsa's pulse quickened. She could feel her father stiffen, could feel the decision settling in his
bones before he even spoke. His grip tightened around her shoulders, as if to shield her from
the very thing she carried within.
