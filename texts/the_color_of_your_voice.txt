In a town where music is everything, Noah Alvarez falls in love the moment he hears Elliot James sing. His voice is utterly enchanting, like magic surging through the air, a sound that flared with Noah’s emotions.
For months, life is a dream. Happiness surges through Noah, burning so bright it feels like he might explode from joy. Every night, laughter fills the air, their voices soaring in harmony. Noah believes they are unstoppable, invincible, eternal.
Then, everything vanishes.
Elliot gets sick. His voice, once majestic, now trembles. Noah watches in horrified silence as the boy he loves pales before him, his laughter gone, lost, vanished.
"You’ll get better," Noah whispers.Elliot just looks away, a lump lodged in his throat.
The doctors deliver the verdict: his voice will never return. The words press against Noah's chest, making it impossible to breathe.
At first, Elliot pretends to be okay, but Noah sees the grief creeping in, the despair pooling in his eyes.
Then, the anger comes. Elliot pushes Noah away, saying, “You don’t get it. You fell in love with my voice. It’s gone. I’m gone.”
Noah trembles with rage. His heart pounds as he yells, “You think I only loved your voice?! That’s all I meant to you?”
Elliot doesn’t yell back. He just looks so small, so pale. His silence is worse than screaming.
Noah slams the door behind him.
Days pass. Weeks. Noah doesn’t sleep. The piano gathers dust, untouched, just like his heart. His world turns gray, heavy, pressing down on him until he can’t move.
Then, a letter.
Elliot’s handwriting.“Write for me.”
Noah collapses into tears, sobbing uncontrollably, grief tearing through him. His fingers tremble as they press the keys again. Music surges through the silence, raw and broken and beautiful.
Elliot is gone.
But Noah still plays.
Because some songs never really end.
The first time Noah plays again, the notes feel empty—like calling into a void and waiting for something that will never answer.
He tries to imagine Elliot hearing him, but the silence in the room is too heavy, too vast, too crushing.
Weeks pass. Months. The world moves forward, but Noah does not.
He stops speaking to people. Stops smiling. Stops pretending.Music was their thing. Now it feels like a wound that will never heal.
Then one night, at the old auditorium where Elliot used to sing, Noah finds something waiting for him:
A cassette tape.
His hands shake as he presses play.
And then—Elliot’s voice. Soft. Faint. A ghost of the boy who once stood on this stage.
“Noah... if you’re hearing this, it means I’m gone.”
A wave of nausea slams into him. His vision spins.
“I knew I was running out of time, but I couldn't let you know. Not when you still believed I’d get better.”
Noah clutches his chest, trying to breathe, trying not to break apart.
“I wasn’t wrong, though. I am still here. Not in the way you wanted, but listen… I was always more than my voice. And so were you.”
Noah’s entire body trembles. The weight of grief, guilt, love, longing—it’s unbearable.
“Write for me.”
The same words from the letter.
Write for me.
Noah sobs, ugly and uncontrollable, his body curling in on itself. His tears drip onto the cassette, mixing with the dust of all the months he let life slip away.
He lost Elliot.But Elliot’s words remain. His music remains.
Noah presses his forehead to the cassette and whispers, “Okay.”
That night, he goes home and writes a song.
A song for Elliot.A song for the boy with a voice like magic, who burned too brightly for this world.
The next day, he plays it on stage.
For the first time since Elliot died, Noah sings.
And the world listens.
