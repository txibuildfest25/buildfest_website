“We will keep her safe,” he promised.

The troll nodded solemnly, but his gaze lingered on Elsa, his expression unreadable. “And you
must learn to control it,” he said, voice gentler this time, but no less firm.

Elsa swallowed hard. How? The magic had never felt like something she controlled—it surged
when it wanted, flared with her emotions, slipped from her grasp like wind through bare
branches. She wanted to believe she could master it, that she could make it harmless, but she
had already failed. Anna had almost—

No. She wouldn't think about that.

As the trolls began to retreat, Elsa felt her father’s hands settle on her shoulders. She looked up
at him, heart pounding. He knelt, his eyes full of something she couldn't quite
name—determination, perhaps. Or fear.

“We'll find a way,” he said. “We'll keep you safe. We'll keep everyone safe.”

Elsa's lips parted, a protest forming, but the words shriveled before she could speak them. Safe.
That was all that mattered. Even if it meant hiding. Even if it meant shutting out everything that
made her... her.

She cast one last glance at Anna, still asleep, peaceful and unaware.

This was the last night her sister would remember them as they were.

And Elsa would never be the same again.
